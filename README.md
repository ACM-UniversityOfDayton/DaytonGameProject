## Semester Project for Spring 2021
- Officers: Mick Ward (President), Jacob Scheetz (Vice President), Anna Duricy (Treasurer)

### Project Description
- During the Spring semester of 2021 the ACM club at UD collaborated on this GitHub project to create a 2D open world driving game. The goal of this project was to give all the members experience working on a collaborative project that mimicked real-world open source software. In addition to this, the project gave all of the members more experience with industry standard programming languages, technology stacks and asset pipelines. By developing this game, all of the members that contributed to this project can confidently say they created a tangible result from working with other students. We hope this game continues to improve in the future and can be passed down through the ACM for years to come! - Jacob
